Origanly it was only devloped for the Boss GT-8 guitar effects procerssor. Collin ([gumtownbassman][gumtownbassman]) adapted it for a wide range of simmilar pedals. 

It allows users to interface with their hardware, like the BOSS GT series or ME series effects processors, from their computer. Through the FXFloorBoard editor, users can edit patches, organize sounds, tweak parameters, and back up settings more conveniently than through the hardwareâ€™s onboard interface.

### Key Features:
- **Graphical Editing Interface**: Provides a visual, easy-to-use platform to modify and create patches.
- **Patch Management**: Users can save, organize, and back up their patches on the computer.
- **Real-Time Control**: It allows for real-time changes to settings on the device from the computer.
- **Multiple Device Support**: Compatible with a range of BOSS/Roland effects processors (GT-100, GT-10, ME-80, etc.).

It is popular among musicians who prefer a more streamlined and visual way to manage their sound setups.

> NOTE: This is a personal fork off my original defunct work on the (Boss GT-8) fx floor board software. I updated it to compile with the latest Qt 5 version. For the latest version see [SourceForge][sourceforge]  where it is maintained by Collin ([gumtownbassman][gumtownbassman]).

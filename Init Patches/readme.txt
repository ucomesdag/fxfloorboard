CUSTOM INIT PATCHES HOW-TO:
---------------------------

1. Create a patch save it as .syx or .syx2.

2. Put the file in this directory.

3. Restart the application.

4. Done!


Note: By default your patch will appear at the bottom of the
      [Init Patches] pull down menu with (My INIT) prepended 
      to it for your convenience.

      When this is not desired do the following:
      ------------------------------------------

      When omitting INIT_ in the patch name the patch will be 
      displayed with (My INIT) prepended to the filename. So 
      to circumvent this add INIT_ to the filename. 

      To change the order of files put xxx_ in front of the 
      filename, where x is a number to control the order it 
      will appear in the "[Init Patches]" pull down menu.
      
      Underscores will be replaced by spaces and "-!-" by "/".
      Because AC/DC is not ACDC, neither AC_DC or AC-DC.

      Possible filenames: 001_INIT_YourFileName.syx
                          002_YourFileName.syx
                          INIT_YourFileName.syx
                          YourFileName.syx
